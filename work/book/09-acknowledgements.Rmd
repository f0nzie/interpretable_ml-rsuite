# Acknowledgements

Writing this book was (and still is) a lot of fun.
But it is also a lot of work and I am very happy about the support I received.

My biggest thank-you goes to Katrin who had the hardest job in terms of hours and effort:
she proofread the book from beginning to end and discovered many spelling mistakes and inconsistencies that I would never have found.
I am very grateful for her support.

A big thanks goes to Verena Haunschmid for writing the section about [LIME explanations for images](#images-lime).
She works in data science and I recommend following her on Twitter: [\@ExpectAPatronum](https://twitter.com/ExpectAPatronum).  
I also want to thank all the [early readers who contributed corrections](https://github.com/christophM/interpretable-ml-book/graphs/contributors) on Github!

Furthermore, I want to thank everyone who created illustrations: 
The cover was designed by my friend [\@YvonneDoinel](https://twitter.com/YvonneDoinel). 
The graphics in the [Shapley Value chapter](#shapley) were created by [Abi Aryan](https://twitter.com/GoAbiAryan), using icons made by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com/) from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
The [awesome frog with the crystal ball](http://www.chojugiga.com/) in the chapter about the [Future of Interpretability](#future) was designed by [\@TopeconHeroes](https://twitter.com/topeconheroes).
Verena Haunschmid created the graphic in the [RuleFit chapter](#rulefit).
I would like to thank all researchers who allowed me to use images from their research articles.


In at least three aspects, the way I published this book is unconventional.
First, it is available both as website and as ebook/pdf.
The software I used to create this book is called `bookdown`, written by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/), who created many R packages that make it easy to combine R code and text.
Thanks a lot!
Secondly, I self-publish the book on the platform [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/), instead of working with a traditional publisher.
And third, I published the book as in-progress book, which has helped me enormously to get feedback and to monetize it along the way.
Many thanks to leanpub for making this possible and handling the royalties fairly.  
I would also like to thank you, dear reader, for reading this book without a big publisher name behind it.

I am grateful for the funding of my research on interpretable machine learning by the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts in the framework of the Centre Digitisation.Bavaria (ZD.B).
